# Audio Directory

This directory contains sound effects and background music for the game.

## Planned Assets:
- `sword_clash.wav` - Sound when attacks hit blocks
- `sword_hit.wav` - Sound when attacks hit opponents
- `jump.wav` - Jump sound effect
- `background_music.ogg` - Looping background music
- `victory.wav` - Round victory sound
- `menu_select.wav` - UI selection sound

## Audio Guidelines:
- Use WAV format for short sound effects
- Use OGG format for longer music tracks
- Keep file sizes reasonable
- Maintain consistent volume levels
